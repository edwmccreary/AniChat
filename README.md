# AniChat
AniChat is a chat program that allows you to draw images and animations and send them to your friends. AniChat works like a traditional chat program, add your friends, send text messages, have group conversations. What makes AniChat unique, is the draw button, which brings up a stream-lined drawing program that allows you to draw images, or add frames to make it an animation.
